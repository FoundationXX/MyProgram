# MyProgram
nFibonacci+nPrime_StringSort

Hi Terry,
    Here is what I have so far. 
    The program is mostly working, except there is mino flaw in the StringSort method. 
    I am not sure if I am doing it right. I have not had enough time to Test everything as thorough as
    I'd like yet, but I will. Please take a look when you have time. Thanks a lot!
